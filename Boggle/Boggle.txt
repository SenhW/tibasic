Boggle
Version 1.1
By: patriotsfan (patriotsfan98@gmail.com)

HOW TO PLAY

	This game is based on the fun word game Boggle. It is probably the best Boggle game out there for the TI-83+. It is not compatible for the TI-84+ since the timer runs too fast.   In order for the program to run on a TI-84+, change the For(Y,1,16 to make the timer run better. If you've never played Boggle, here are the basic rules:

	1. Words can be formed horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to the left, right or up-and-down.

	2. Any words in the English language are acceptable as long as they are not proper nouns. Words within words are also valid.

	3. SCORING

		NO. OF LETTERS  3  4  5  6  7  8 or more

		POINTS                 1  1  2  3  5  11

	4. REMEMBER THAT Q IS Qu!

VERSIONS

	Version 1.1: 1328 bytes Knocked off almost half of the original program size! Improved speed and now you can press CLEAR to go back to the main menu during gameplay. Also, I fixed a minor bug that would let you press any key instead of just 2nd to begin.

	Version 1.0: 2277 bytes First and hopefully last release
