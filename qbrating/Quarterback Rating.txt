By: patriotsfan (patriotsfan98@gmail.com)

For all who are curious about the rating system, here it is:

Attempts-A
Completions-C
Yards-Y
Touchdown passes-T
Interceptions-I

NFL and CFL

1. (C/A-0.3)/0.2
2. (Y/A-3)/4
3. T/A/0.05
4. (0.095-(I/A))/0.04

Add all four steps, multiply by 100 and divide by 6. The final number is the quarterback rating.

NOTE: The sum of each step cannot be less than zero or greater than 2.375.

NCAA

1. (8.4Y+330T-200I+100C)/A=quarterback rating

AFL

1. (((C/A)100)-30)/20
2. ((T/A)100)/(20/3
3. (9.5-((I/A)100))/4
4. ((Y/A)-3)/4

Add all four steps and divide by 0.06. The final number is the quarterback rating.

NOTE: The sum of each step cannot be less than zero or greater than 2.375.
